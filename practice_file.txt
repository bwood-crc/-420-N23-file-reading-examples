The input file ($input) is the name of the file you need use by the read command 1. 
The read command reads the file line by line, assigning each line to the $line bash shell variable. 
Once all lines are read from the file the bash while loop will stop. The internal field 9 separator (IFS) 
is set to the empty string to preserve whitespace issues. This is a fail-safe feature. 
The -r option is used not to allow backslashes to escape any characters.
